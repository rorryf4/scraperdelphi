Kirby Smart enters his 10th season (Jesus am I getting old) coaching the Bulldogs, and if anybody’s going to make a run at Nick Saban’s incredible run of success at Alabama, it’s going to be Kirby Smart. He’s had Georgia in the SEC championship game every single non-COVID season since his first one in Athens, winning two national championships, playing in a third national championship game and winning 4 SEC titles in his first 9 seasons. By those lofty standards, 2024’s SEC title and #2 national seed was almost a disappointment, since the Bulldogs lost 3 games, something they hadn’t done <em>in the three previous seasons combined!</em> While we’ll never know if things might have turned out different had QB Carson Beck not suffered a season-ending injury in the SEC championship game (simmer down, Florida State fans), the Bulldogs season ultimately ended in New Orleans to eventual national champion runners-up Notre Dame.</p> <p><strong>Roster outlook</strong></p> <p>To say the Bulldogs lost a lot after 2024 would be an understatement. Georgia enters 2025 ranked 105th in returning production, ahead of only two teams (Oregon and Ole Miss) among the top 50 teams in this countdown. They lost 13 players to the NFL draft, including 3 first rounders and 6 players among the first 100 drafted. That doesn’t include their 2 year starting QB Carson Beck, who many thought would have declared for the draft but after that elbow injury he decided to instead hit the portal and will be once again facing Notre Dame, this time in a Miami uniform. On offense, it did include the loss of the entire interior OL, plus RB Trevor Etienne and WRs Arian Smith and Dominic Lovett. That’s not to say they have nothing back. Backup QB Gunner Stockton, who finished up the SEC Championship game and played in the Sugar Bowl, is expected to be the starting QB, and RB Nate Frazier returns as well. WR Dillon Bell, who amassed 466 receiving yards is also there. On defense, the loss of 7 starters to the draft, including 3 more DL, is a lot to ask, even knowing that Georgia has routinely been doing this now for several years (just ask the NFL champion Eagles). Kirby has been eating as a recruiter, and last year was no different, bringing in the #2 class in all of college football. He went much lighter on the portal, with the 24th best class in the country (good enough for a ridiculous 12th in the SEC). That does include two new 4 star WRs, Noah Thomas (Texas A&amp;M) and Zachariah Branch (USC).</p> <p><strong>Schedule and outlook</strong></p> <p>Georgia will ease those new players into form with a couple of tune-up games (Marshall and Austin Peay) before they jump right into the teeth of their SEC schedule, traveling to Knoxville to face Tennessee. Given the Vols will likely take a bit of a step back after last season’s CFB run and the whole Nico fiasco, that will likely be a good ramp up in intensity, because following a bye, they host Alabama. As tempting as it is to joke that the next game against Kentucky is another bye, the Wildcats have a knack for making Georgia work for their wins though, to be fair, that’s usually in Lexington). They follow that up with at Auburn, home against Ole Miss and then the last Cocktail Party in Jacksonville until 2028. They wrap up with their last SEC road game at Mississippi State, hosting Texas in a potential SEC championship preview, Charlotte for their SEC late season cupcake special and then <del>Clean Old-Fashioned Hate</del> the Invesco QQQ Atlanta Gridiron Classic. If Smart runs through that schedule with 2 or fewer losses, the Bulldogs are as likely as anybody to be playing for the championship in 2025.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/usffan""> /u/usffan </a> <br /> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1muisqz/preseason_rankings_countdown_4_days_to_the_start/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1muisqz/preseason_rankings_countdown_4_days_to_the_start/"">[comments]</a></span>","Reddit,CFB",2025-08-19T17:15:56.423296+00:00,https://www.reddit.com

The <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB"">/r/CFB</a> annual Pick 'Em Contest is back!</p> <h1><a href=""http://pickem.redditcfb.com/"">Link to /r/CFB's Pick 'Em site</a></h1> <p>We're excited to announce that <strong><a href=""https://www.homefieldapparel.com/"">Homefield Apparel</a>!</strong> is running it back as our Pick 'Em's title sponsor.</p> <p>Homefield Apparel creates some of the softest, most comfortable shirts, crewnecks, and hoodies with the best vintage collegiate designs on the market. Their high-quality goods are thoughtfully designed in the USA and feature more than 125 colleges, including almost every P4 school! Use <strong>REDDITCFB</strong> as your promo code to get 15% off your first order.</p> <p>We're also excited to welcome back <a href=""https://www.yeti.com/""><strong>YETI</strong></a> as a sponsor! They've got some great products as prizes to look out for.</p> <h2><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB"">/r/CFB</a> Pick 'Em 101</h2> <p><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB"">/r/CFB</a> Pick 'Em returns back and better than ever!</p> <p>Everyone by default is signed up for the official subreddit group, which is the pool that prizes will be drawn from.</p> <p>The <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB"">/r/CFB</a> Pick 'Em uses a <strong>Confidence Points</strong> system. We use confidence points because they are accessible to people unfamiliar with odds &amp; spreads, require a bit more skill, and can aid high risk-high reward strategies.</p> <p>For the official subreddit group, you will be selecting the winners from a list of 10 games, chosen by the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB"">/r/CFB</a> Pick 'Em team.</p> <p>Before the games start, you should:</p> <ol> <li>Pick which team you think will win each game.</li> <li>Order the winners assigning the most points to the teams you are most confident will win.</li> </ol> <p>For instance, if you are very confident, for example, that Alabama will beat their FCS opponent, then you want to give that game 10 points. If you think a game will be a toss-up, then you will want to give that game 1 point.</p> <p>The games are ordered by time. If you have missed games, you will only miss the lowest set of points. For instance, if you miss the first game, you only miss out on getting the 1 point game. If you miss the first two games, you miss out on 1+2 points and so on. This is to minimize your potential lost points if you forget to submit all of your picks in time.</p> <p>If a game is canceled for any reason, the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB"">/r/CFB</a> Pick 'Em team will automatically sort the points from the canceled game to the bottom and give credit as picking correctly to all users. Example: If you had a game canceled at 7 points, we'll move it to 1 point (and award the point), and move everything that you had at 1-6 up one point. This is the fairest approach we can think of and seemed to work well last year.</p> <p>The contest will run from Week 1 through Week 15 (the Conference Championship Weekend).</p> <h3>Custom Leagues</h3> <p>You can also make or participate in your own Custom Leagues. Each league will have an admin that creates the group that can add any set of games involving FBS teams they want each week and invite other users to join.</p> <h2>Prizes for the official subreddit group</h2> <p>Official Prizes for the 2025 <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB"">/r/CFB</a> Pick 'Em from Homefield and YETI will be announced next week at the official kickoff, and we're pretty excited! </p> <p>In the event of a tie for a prize, tied users will submit their prediction for the score of the Army-Navy game. The first tiebreaker will be the difference between predicted spreads and the actual spread, second tiebreaker (if necessary) will be the difference between predicted totals and the actual total. In the rare chance there is still a tie after the tiebreakers, the prize(s) will be decided by coin flip.</p> <h2>Notes &amp; General Disclaimers</h2> <ul> <li>Season prizes will be awarded and shipped in mid-to-late January 2025.</li> <li>Winners and standings will be announced prior to December 11th if there is no tie following Conference Championship Weekend.</li> <li>In the event of a tie, winners will be asked for their tiebreakers prediction prior to December 10th.

The preseason poll is open!</p> <p>Thanks to everyone for helping make the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB"">/r/CFB</a> poll one of the most successful projects on the sub!</p> <p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p> <p><em>Q: I've applied! When will I hear whether or not I was selected?</em> </p> <p>A: I may add some applicants early if they apply in time, but the bulk of new voters will be announced <strong>with the Week 2 poll results</strong>. Prospective voters who wish to participate in the preseason poll and/or Week 2 poll should go ahead and vote in it. In the event you are selected, your ballot will be converted to a main voter ballot at the time you are selected.</p> <p><em>Q: I missed the deadline and/or wasn't selected to be a main voter. What can I do to participate?</em> </p> <p>A: Please feel free to join the conversation in the weekly poll results. As poll thread participation is one of the criteria used to select new voters, this will improve your application should you apply again next year.</p> <p>Additionally, all users may vote in the poll as provisional voters as long as they are members in good standing. Doing so will also improve your application should you apply again next year.</p> <p><em>Q: How many people normally get selected? How many apply?</em> </p> <p>A: The number of people selected is a function of how many current participants there are and the quality of the applications received. Number of applications has ranged between 200 and 1,200 over the last nine years. The number invited this year will depend on the application pool and the response I get from returning voters, but it will be in the ballpark of around 50.</p> <p><em>Q: How do you determine who gets selected?</em> </p> <p>A: The qualities we're looking for are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>How long a user has been participating on <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB"">/r/CFB</a> (usually the minimum required here is 1+ years, but there are rare exceptions).<br /></li> <li>How much a user contributes to <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB"">/r/CFB</a> and the quality of those contributions<br /></li> <li>Participation in poll threads</li> <li>Participation in the poll as a provisional voter</li> <li>Poll balance needs in terms of conference and teams, proportional to the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB"">/r/CFB</a> userbase</li> </ul> <p>NOTE: <strong>As of 2024</strong>, the application no longer features essay questions and is not a major component of the selection process (although you should still take care to answer everything accurately).</p> <p><em>Q: I accidentally submitted my application twice. What do?</em> </p> <p>A: No worries, I'll use the second submission.</p> <p><em>Q: I am a returning voter, but I changed usernames. What do I do?</em> </p> <p>A: PM me, preferably from the old account, and let me know your new username.</p> <p><em>Q: I am a returning voter from last season, do I need to reapply?</em></p> <p>A: No. The preseason poll is open, feel free to go ahead and submit your ballot.</p> <p><em>Q: I am a returning voter from last season, did I miss the notice of the preseason poll opening?</em></p> <p>A: Maybe.
